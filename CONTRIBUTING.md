# Contributing

## Getting Started

We welcome new contributors to the project!
If you're interested, please check for [issues labeled with `up-for-grabs`
that are not yet in progress](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/issues?q=sort%3Aupdated-desc%20is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aup-for-grabs%20-label%3A%22status%3A%20in%20progress%22).
Generally, before you work on an issue, post a comment and ask whether it can be started.
Please wait for the core team to respond and assign the issue to you before making any code
changes.

## Commit Messages

As a general rule, the style and formatting of commit messages should follow the guidelines in
[How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).

In addition, any commit that is related to an existing issue must reference the issue.
For example, if a commit in a pull request addresses issue \#999, it must contain the
following at the bottom of the commit message.

```
Issue: #999
```

## Pull Requests

Our [Definition of Done](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/wiki/Definition-of-Done)
(DoD) offers some guidelines on what we expect from a pull request.
Feel free to open a pull request that does not fulfill all criteria, e.g. to discuss
a certain change before polishing it, but please be aware that we will only merge it
once the DoD is met.

Please add the following lines to your pull request description:

## Coding Conventions

### Naming Conventions

Whenever an acronym is included as part of a type name or method name, keep the first
letter of the acronym uppercase and use lowercase for the rest of the acronym. Otherwise,
it becomes _impossible_ to perform camel-cased searches in IDEs, and it becomes
potentially very difficult for mere humans to read or reason about the element without
reading documentation (if documentation even exists).

Consider for example a use case needing to support an HTTP URL. Calling the method
`getHTTPURL()` is absolutely horrible in terms of usability; whereas, `getHttpUrl()` is
great in terms of usability. The same applies for types `HTTPURLProvider` vs
`HttpUrlProvider`, etc.

Whenever an acronym is included as part of a field name or parameter name:

- If the acronym comes at the start of the field or parameter name, use lowercase for the
  entire acronym -- for example, `String url;`.
- Otherwise, keep the first letter of the acronym uppercase and use lowercase for the
  rest of the acronym -- for example, `String defaultUrl;`.

### Formatting

#### Code

Code formatting is enforced using the [Spotless](https://github.com/diffplug/spotless)
Gradle plugin. You can use `gradle spotlessApply` to format new code and add missing
license headers to source files. Formatter and import order settings for Eclipse are
available in the repository under
[junit-eclipse-formatter-settings.xml](gradle/config/eclipse/junit-eclipse-formatter-settings.xml)
and [junit-eclipse.importorder](gradle/config/eclipse/junit-eclipse.importorder),
respectively. For IntelliJ IDEA there's a
[plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/6546) you can use in conjunction with the
Eclipse settings.

It is forbidden to use _wildcard imports_ (e.g., `import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.*;`)
in Java code.

#### Documentation

Text in `*.adoc` and `*.md` files should be wrapped at 90 characters whenever technically
possible.

In multi-line bullet point entries, subsequent lines should be indented.

### Spelling

Use American English spelling rules when writing documentation as well as for
code -- class names, method names, variable names, etc.

### Javadoc

- Javadoc comments should be wrapped after 80 characters whenever possible.
- This first paragraph must be a single, concise sentence that ends with a period (`.`).
- Place `<p>` on the same line as the first line of a new paragraph and precede `<p>` with a blank line.
- Insert a blank line before at-clauses/tags.
- Favor `{@code foo}` over `<code>foo</code>`.
- Favor literals (e.g., `{@literal @}`) over HTML entities.
- New classes and methods should declare a `@since ...` tag.
- Use `@since 5.10` instead of `@since 5.10.0`.
- Do not use `@author` tags. Instead, contributors are listed on the [GitHub](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/graphs/contributors) page.
- Do not use verbs in third-person form in the first sentence of the Javadoc for a method -- for example, use "Discover tests..." instead of "Discovers tests...".

#### Examples

See [`ExtensionContext`](junit-jupiter-api/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/ExtensionContext.java) and
[`ParameterContext`](junit-jupiter-api/src/main/java/org/junit/jupiter/api/extension/ParameterContext.java) for example Javadoc.


### Nullability

This project uses JSpecify's annotation to indicate nullability. In general, the approach
is as follows:

- All packages are annotated with `@NullMarked`
- Types of fields, parameters, return types etc. may be annotated with `@Nullable`

### Tests

#### Naming

- All test classes must end with a `Tests` suffix.
- Example test classes that should not be picked up by the build must end with a `TestCase` suffix.

#### Assertions

- Use `org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions` for simple assertions.
- Use AssertJ when richer assertions are needed.
- Do not use `org.junit.Assert` or `junit.framework.Assert`.

#### Mocking and Stubbing

- Use either [Mockito](https://github.com/mockito/mockito) or hand-written test doubles.

### Logging

- In general, logging should be used sparingly.
- All logging must be performed via the internal `Logger` façade provided via the JUnit [LoggerFactory](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/blob/main/junit-platform-commons/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/commons/logging/LoggerFactory.java).
- Levels defined in JUnit's [Logger](https://github.com/junit-team/junit-framework/blob/main/junit-platform-commons/src/main/java/org/junit/platform/commons/logging/Logger.java) façade, which delegates to Java Util Logging (JUL) for the actual logging.
  - _error_ (JUL: `SEVERE`, Log4J: `ERROR`): extra information (in addition to an Exception) about errors that will halt execution
  - _warn_ (JUL: `WARNING`, Log4J: `WARN`): potential usage or configuration errors that should not halt execution
  - _info_ (JUL: `INFO`, Log4J: `INFO`): information the users might want to know but not by default
  - _config_ (JUL: `CONFIG`, Log4J: `CONFIG`): information related to configuration of the system (Example: `ServiceLoaderTestEngineRegistry` logs IDs of discovered engines)
  - _debug_ (JUL: `FINE`, Log4J: `DEBUG`)
  - _trace_ (JUL: `FINER`, Log4J: `TRACE`)

### Deprecation

The JUnit project uses the `@API` annotation from [API Guardian](https://github.com/apiguardian-team/apiguardian).
Publicly available interfaces, classes, and methods have a defined lifecycle
which is described in detail in the [User Guide](https://docs.junit.org/current/user-guide/#api-evolution).

That following describes the deprecation process followed for API items.

To deprecate an item:
- Update the `@API.status` to `DEPRECATED`.
- Update `@API.since`. Please note `since` describes the version when the
  status was changed and not the introduction of the element.
- Add the `@Deprecated` Java annotation on the item.
- Add the `@deprecated` JavaDoc tag to describe the deprecation, and refer to
  an eventual replacement.
- If the item is used in existing code, add `@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")`
  to make the build pass.

## Building the Project

Please refer to [the readme](README.md#building-from-source) for the most common
build commands.

### Build Parameters

The build can be influenced by a number of parameters. For example, measuring
JaCoCo code coverage of Test tasks can be enabled, or Predictive Test Selection
disabled. To see the full list, please run the following task:

`./gradlew :plugins:build-parameters:parameters`
